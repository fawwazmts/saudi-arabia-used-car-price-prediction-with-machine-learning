# **Saudi Used Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning**

## Overview

This project aims to predict the price of used cars in Saudi Arabia using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to used cars and affects the price of the car. The goal is to create a predictive model that can help platforms like syarah.com provide competitive price predictions for sellers and buyers.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore a dataset of used cars in Saudi Arabia. The dataset includes both raw and processed versions of the data, along with a description file that explains the features. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature selection, and modeling to predict car prices using various algorithms.
